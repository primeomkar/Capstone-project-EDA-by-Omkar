A few thousands of new applications are regularly uploaded on Google play store. A huge number of designers working freely on designing the apps and making them successful. With the enormous challenge from everywhere throughout the globe, it is important for a developer to know whether he/she is continuing the correct way or not. Since most Play Store applications are free, the income model is very obscure and inaccessible regarding how the in-application buys, in-application adverts and memberships add to the achievement of an application. In this way, an application's prosperity is normally dictated by the quantity of installation of the application and the client appraisals that it has gotten over its lifetime instead of the income is created. The objective of this experiment is to deliver insights to understand customer demands better and thus help developers to popularize the product. We have tried to discover the relationships among various attributes such as which application is free or paid, what are the user reviews, rating of the application.
